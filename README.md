# Battleship

I made a mostly-functional but extremely barebones Battleship game in Python. The purpose was to experiment with displaying a modifiable gameboard grid using as little repeated code and functions as possible.
To play you place your two ships and then choose where to attack. The catch is that you're attacking your own ships and can see where they are. Also, if you somehow don't win within the minimum number of turns to end the game (4) you win anyway.
